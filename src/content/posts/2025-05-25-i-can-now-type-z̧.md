I upgraded my MacBook (named `macm1`) to MacOS Whatever and it seems like the way you input [cedilla](https://www.wordnik.com/words/cedilla) in the ABC Extended keyboard has changed.

I think that pressing `option+c` used to output `ç` but now it's a dead key for `¸`.
A dead key means that the `¸` can be combined with other keys to generate combinations like: `ņ`, `ẹ` and of course `ç`.

You may ask: when would I ever need to type a combination like `¸` or `ḩ`?

Well, here it is, a blog post that needed it.
